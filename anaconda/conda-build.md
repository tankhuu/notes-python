# [Conda-Build](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda-build/en/latest/index.html)

Conda-build contains commands and tools to use conda to build your own packages. It also provides helpful tools to constrain or pin versions in recipes. Building a conda package requires installing conda-build and creating a conda recipe. You then use the conda build command to build the conda package from the conda recipe.
